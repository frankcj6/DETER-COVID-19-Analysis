# DETER-COVID-19-Analysis
This project is part of the analysis and exploration performed on the DETER COVID-19 trace data under the supervision of Professor Debra Laefer.
The original project contains ArcGIS data cleaning and wrangling as well as the initial analysis. 
In this project, we focus on the analysis part. We discover the pattern of distribution of our data and created a 3D-visualization. Also, we fitted multiple regression models and multi-level models to evaluate its accuracy and the relationship between each variable. 
Please contact DS3 or me before using any data and source codes in this project.
